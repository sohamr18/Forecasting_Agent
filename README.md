This agent takes a dataframe as input using streamlit UI. It needs to have a date column and a value column.
It will then ask you to prompt what type of forecast you want. For now it only supports exponential smoothing.

1. Put your credentials in .env file
2. Install requirements
3. In the root directory, run "streamlit run code.py"
